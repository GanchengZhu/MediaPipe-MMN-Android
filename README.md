# Android MediaPipe MNN Inference

## 1. Project Description
- Android test code for MediaPipe model inference using the MNN framework.

## 2. Reference Projects
1. **[MediaPipe](https://github.com/google/mediapipe)**  
   Google's official multimedia machine learning pipeline framework.

2. **[MediaPipe-MNN](https://github.com/MirrorYuChen/Mediapipe-MNN)**  
   A community integration of MediaPipe with Alibaba's MNN inference engine for efficient model deployment.

## Key Features
- Demonstrates MediaPipe model deployment on the Android platform
- Integrates MNN inference engine for optimized performance
- Provides a sample implementation for model inference testing

## Compatibility
- Tested with Android API level 24+ (Nougat and higher)
- Requires Android NDK for native code compilation

> Note: This project focuses specifically on demonstrating the inference workflow rather than providing full framework implementation.
